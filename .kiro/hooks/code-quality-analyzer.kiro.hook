Focus on:\n\n1. **Code Smells**: Identify any code smells such as duplicated code, long methods, large classes, excessive parameters, or inappropriate intimacy between classes.\n\n2. **Design Patterns**: Suggest applicable design patterns that could improve the code structure and maintainability.\n\n3. **Best Practices**: Check adherence to TypeScript/React/Next.js best practices including:\n   - Proper type safety and strict TypeScript usage\n   - React hooks usage and component patterns\n   - Next.js App Router conventions\n   - Error handling patterns\n   - Async/await usage\n\n4. **Readability**: Evaluate code clarity including:\n   - Variable and function naming\n   - Code organization and structure\n   - Comment quality and necessity\n   - Complexity reduction opportunities\n\n5. **Maintainability**: Assess long-term maintainability:\n   - Modularity and separation of concerns\n   - Testability\n   - Dependency management\n   - Code coupling and cohesion\n\n6. **Performance**: Identify potential performance optimizations:\n   - Unnecessary re-renders in React\n   - Inefficient algorithms or data structures\n   - Memory leaks or resource management issues\n   - Bundle size considerations\n\nProvide specific, actionable suggestions while maintaining the existing functionality. Prioritize the most impactful improvements and explain the reasoning behind each suggestion."
