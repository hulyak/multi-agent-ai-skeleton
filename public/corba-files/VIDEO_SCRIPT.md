# CrewOS: CORBA Reborn - Video Script (3 Minutes)

## Opening (8 seconds)

"CrewOS resurrects 1990s CORBA IDL as modern AI agents. Mission-critical CORBA systems in telecom, aerospace, and finance can't be easily rewritten. We built a parser that converts verbose IDL to clean Kiro YAML specs."

---

## Part 1: Landing Page (18 seconds)

"Here's the landing page with the before/after comparison. On the left, verbose CORBA IDL requiring compilers and stub generation. On the right, clean Kiro specs with auto-generated types and tests.

Legacy interfaces don't have to stay complex. Below are two demo applications built from resurrected code."

---

## Part 2: Resurrection Lab (30 seconds)

"Let's go to the Resurrection Lab with the Support Agent demo.

Three stages: parsing extracts interfaces and methods, conversion transforms CORBA types to TypeScript and generates YAML, completion validates the output.

The before and after comparison shows the transformation. Verbose CORBA IDL becomes clean Kiro YAML ready to download and use."

---

## Part 3: Support Agent Demo (20 seconds)

"Here's the Support Agent in action, built from SupportAgent.idl.

Customer queries flow through specialized agents: IntentDetection classifies, FAQAgent searches, ResponseGen creates responses, CitationAgent adds references.

A real application from legacy IDL."

---

## Part 4: Research Agent Demo (8 seconds)

"The Research Agent handles document retrieval, summarization, and citations. Agents coordinate through an event-driven message bus."

---

## Part 5: Technical Summary (22 seconds)

"CrewOS has three layers: Resurrection Engine for parsing, Multi-Agent Orchestration for routing, and Agent Implementations for functionality.

Built with Kiro's spec-driven workflow: 8 user stories, 40 acceptance criteria, 19 correctness properties, 100+ property tests. Result: 13,000 lines of code and two working applications."

---

## Closing (8 seconds)

"AI agents can modernize legacy architectures. Organizations don't have to discard decades of specifications—they can resurrect them with Kiro."

## Total Speaking Time: 2 minutes 54 seconds

**Breakdown:**
- Opening: 8s
- Landing Page: 18s
- Resurrection Lab: 30s
- Support Demo: 20s
- Research Demo: 8s
- Technical Summary: 22s
- Closing: 8s

**Pacing Notes:**
- Speak clearly at a natural pace
- Pause briefly between sections for visual transitions
- Emphasize key numbers (100+, 50, 8,000+, 19)
- Focus on value and transformation, not visual elements
- Let the UI speak for itself
